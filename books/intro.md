## Neurodesk environment

Each Jupyter notebook in the repository is equipped with a Google Colab button at the top. This button will allow you to interact with the notebooks in a cloud-based environment. The environment is pre-configured to support Neurodesk, so you can start experimenting with the notebooks right away without having to install any additional software or packages.
