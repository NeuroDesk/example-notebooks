# example-notebooks

If you're planning to create a new example notebook, please follow these steps:

1. Access the Template: Start by accessing the `template.ipynb` file. This is our standard template for creating new example notebooks which includes the standard setup for Neurodesk.

2. Create a New Notebook: Make sure your notebook runs as expected. This includes sections for the introduction, data preparation, analysis, results. An automiatic Github Action will bloc the publication of your Example Notebook if it does not run entirely.

3. Save and Submit: Once you're done, save your notebook and submit it for review. You can do this by creating a pull request on our GitHub repository.
